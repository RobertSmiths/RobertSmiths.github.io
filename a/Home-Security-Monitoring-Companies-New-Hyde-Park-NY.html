<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
