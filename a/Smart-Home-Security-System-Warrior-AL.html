<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
