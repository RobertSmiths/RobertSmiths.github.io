<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a great security camera and an incredible worth. It gets an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is simpler to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.

The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
