You can generally fine-tune the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to animal activity or passing automobiles if the camera is near a window, and you can produce a schedule that turns the sensors on and off throughout certain hours of the day.</p>
<p>Combined with effective new software referred to as video analytics, an IP security camera can be programmed to "view" for suspicious activity. A camera on an air consumption, for instance, can be configured to show a record and alert video just when the area around the consumption is disturbed.
