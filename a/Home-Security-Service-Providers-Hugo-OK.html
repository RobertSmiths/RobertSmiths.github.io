<p>3 big advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, portability and expandability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, usually avoid making irreversible changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and setting up long-term electrical circuits.

Wireless control panels, sensing units and other components can quickly be set up at various properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new elements too. Wireless security strategies also permit remote control of the system and basic home automation.
