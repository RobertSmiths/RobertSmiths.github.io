Nevertheless, you will have to pay for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) monthly, and this does not included professional monitoring.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
