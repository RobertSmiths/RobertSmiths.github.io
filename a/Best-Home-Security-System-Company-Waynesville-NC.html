<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a really typical kind of two piece sensing unit that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either generally open or generally closed when under the impact of an electromagnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the 2nd piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, once again based upon whether the style is normally open or generally closed. This action paired with an electrical existing (normally at 12V DC) permits an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit.

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the exact very same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
