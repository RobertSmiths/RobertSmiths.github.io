What you typically find at shops are consumer-grade cameras, which normally come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and cost less than a thousand dollars (US $) for the set. The second category of camera, commercial-grade cameras, typically begins at about $400 (United States) per camera-- a significantly greater cost. The video recorder should be acquired individually, and commercial grade recorders begin at about $500 (US $) and can vary as much as $5000 depending upon the quantity of storage, camera connection, and image processing features.</p>
