Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you stroll by.
