<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the maker's statistics given that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit limited to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>If you have a larger home or residential or commercial property you want to watch on, SimpliSafe might be too limited for you.
