<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the porch by a certified electrical expert (who occurs to be my other half).

Its Wi-Fi connection and battery make it easy to install virtually anywhere a ladder can reach. Doorbell cameras have actually become a popular security tool. When the doorbell is pressed, these cameras can help monitor who's at the door and can record video. Doorbell cameras are some of the most economical camera options.</p>
<p>Although 1080p is usually the standard resolution for cameras we've tested, there are benefits to designs with higher-resolution sensing units.

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
