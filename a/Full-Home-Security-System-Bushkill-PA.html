With conventional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transferred in analog format for local viewing from one main monitoring location. But that does not indicate you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to take advantage of your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

IP cameras can also be connected to what is referred to as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out data from the camera and supplies power to it.

<p>If you live in a small apartment and wish to keep tabs on things when you're not home, a security camera can do the job for a lot less money than what you'll pay for a full security system.

You can typically fine-tune the camera's motion level of sensitivity to avoid false alarms due to animal activity or passing cars and trucks if the camera is near a window, and you can produce a schedule that turns the sensing units on and off throughout certain hours of the day.</p>
