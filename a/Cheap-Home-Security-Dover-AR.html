<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
