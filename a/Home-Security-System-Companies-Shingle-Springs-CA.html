<p>so say you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I advise to have actually cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
