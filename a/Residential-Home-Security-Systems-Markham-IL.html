<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you mean to store and how long you plan to keep taped video footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space quickly.

The camera could legally do what a peeping tom could not do. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side.
