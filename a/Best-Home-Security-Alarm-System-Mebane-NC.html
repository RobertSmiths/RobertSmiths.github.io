<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Great clarity. I wished to establish viewing on my cellular phone however had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter informs, for example. However, those functions come at a comparatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for thirty days of video history.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
