<p>C. False Burglar Alarm. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. If using 4G LTE cellular or IP Web, Select either landline or the appropriate interactive service. Select billing duration: Regular monthly or Yearly. We get a 15% prepay discount from our UL main station provider which we pass on to our yearly customers. This is NOT an agreement, rather a yearly prepay discount rate. When I ultimately got into the camera controls, I was reasonably pleased.
