<h3>Security Cameras For Your Home in Castle Rock CO</h3>
<p>Residence: Best for wise homes-- Residence gives you special equipment functions plus versatile expert monitoring. Quite the powerhouse combo.

<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering several years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet cost effective systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
