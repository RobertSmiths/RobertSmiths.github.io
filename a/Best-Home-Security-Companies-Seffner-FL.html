<p>A little more pricey than our winning clever alarm, this system was almost as basic to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensing units had actually been triggered. We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is produced by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect signals).

This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
