<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
