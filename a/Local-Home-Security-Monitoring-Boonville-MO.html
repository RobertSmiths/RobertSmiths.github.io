Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
