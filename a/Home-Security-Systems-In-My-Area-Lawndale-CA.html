Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
