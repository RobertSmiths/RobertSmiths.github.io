IP cameras can likewise be connected to what is referred to as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out information from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a different power source, meaning a more complicated setup and more wires. PoE switches are also generally considered as a more secure method to transmit information.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
