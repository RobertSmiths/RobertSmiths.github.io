<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident.
