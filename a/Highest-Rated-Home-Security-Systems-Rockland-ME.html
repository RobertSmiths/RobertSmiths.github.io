<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
