<p>Many wireless home security systems are can be installed by the property owner and have an easy setup process. However security systems that need a phone line connection are generally more advanced and need expert installation by a technician. That stated, we really liked Brinks' simple package alternatives. You'll have 3 choices to select from, which vary from basic intrusion protection to full-on intrusion protection + home automation + video surveillance.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
