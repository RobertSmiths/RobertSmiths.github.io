I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for example. Nevertheless, those functions come at a relatively steep cost: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for thirty days of video history.

"When the crime and offence figures were adapted to take account of the basic down pattern in offences and criminal offenses," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular categories but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had actually reduced crime overall in the city centre."

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating advanced clever home enthusiasts or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, consisting of smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.
