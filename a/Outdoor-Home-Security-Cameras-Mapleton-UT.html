<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
