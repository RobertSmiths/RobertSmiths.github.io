<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an appealing cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
<p>Include smart-home devices and control whatever from your mobile device. The camera is the star of your system, and what you'll wish to spend a lot of time taking a look at.

This isn't the most inexpensive SimpliSafe package, but we think the addition of smoke protection is a plus worth spending for.</p>
