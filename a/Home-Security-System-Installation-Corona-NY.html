Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies whenever you walk by.
