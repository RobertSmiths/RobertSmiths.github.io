The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image.

<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see below) technically has all the very same smarts and more in-depth 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , due to the fact that its image quality is still exceptional, and it's somewhat better worth - though its rate is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the money is all the usual Arlo characteristics in terms of the strong develop quality, superb camera video, tons of creative features and a polished app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
