<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, enabling audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses assigned to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more knowledge to setup, and generally cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensing units communicate with a control panel. These are available in 2 kinds: they can be a physical panel that's installed within the home on a wall, or a virtual panel that's regulated and available by means of smart device or tablet.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR transforms the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and after that shops it on a hard disk drive for later retrieval. Displays can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to communicate via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
