Most homes currently have wireless smoke or emergency alarm, but you can link the alarm to your security system to add another layer of protection that might save your life or property.

<p>Analog high definition cameras are a great choice for services to update from analog CCTV that has actually already been wired using coax cable or CAT-5 cable.

While pro monitoring expenses more, it's more secure. Your monitoring company will get the alert and then inform the authorities for you when something triggers your alarm. Looks like a much safer bet to us.</p>
