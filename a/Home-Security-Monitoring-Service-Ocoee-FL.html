I'm not exactly sure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera carries out all that well when it's foggy or raining, especially during the night when weather conditions really mess with the night vision. Still, you're best about the Arlo Pro not doing anything to keep rain from striking the lens cover.</p>

Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you choose a three-year agreement, but considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better offer for you. If you understand you'll sit tight for a minimum of three years, choose the agreement and reap those cost savings. However if you might upgrade to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best choice.</p>
