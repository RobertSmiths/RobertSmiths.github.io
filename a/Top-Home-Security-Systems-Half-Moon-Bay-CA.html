Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a number of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you intend to save and the length of time you plan to keep taped footage. The video is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution.
