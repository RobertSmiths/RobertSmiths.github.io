<p>C. False Burglar Alarm. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. If using 4G LTE cellular or IP Web, Select either landline or the correct interactive service. Select billing period: Yearly or monthly. We get a 15% prepay discount rate from our UL main station provider which we hand down to our yearly consumers.

The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the individual being seen understand they're being watched, and you can select to record video clips or photos and save them to your smart device on a whim.</p>
