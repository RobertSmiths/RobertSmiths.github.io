<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and minimize criminal activity. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with horrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was defective, and so we might revisit this evaluation. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud.

Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
