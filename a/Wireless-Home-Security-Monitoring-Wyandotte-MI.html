<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. With years of experience setting up and monitoring video and audio security systems for Seattle homes and companies, we've developed great relationships with both local police and their customers. Likewise, do not forget that your wireless network security can be sometimes weak, and susceptible to exploits.
