<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to deal with the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared essential WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
