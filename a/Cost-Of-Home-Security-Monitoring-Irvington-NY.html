<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
