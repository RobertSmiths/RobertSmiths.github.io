<p>Thanks to current advancements in technology, wireless security systems are now as efficient as wired systems If you've made the decision to install an alarm system, you must consider the following advantages of wireless innovation. The $260 Fundamentals bundle includes the base station, a keypad, four entry sensors, one motion sensing unit, a backyard indication, and two window decals. For $15 each month, you can add around-the-clock professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive strategy adds control by means of iOS and Android smart device apps, push and e-mail signals, and 30-day event-footage storage for unlimited cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is available individually. Without the $25 plan, you deal with all controls by means of the keypad.</p>
