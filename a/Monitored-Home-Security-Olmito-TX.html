<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
