Which's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
