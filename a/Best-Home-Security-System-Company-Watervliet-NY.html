<p>Lots of home security systems are controlled by mobile phones and that trend will continue. Systems will have less wall-mounted keypads, and instead, offer more controls to more devices. Wireless door, window, glass break, motion, water and freeze sensors interact with a hub or base station in your home. The primary control must be centrally situated in your house and have full-time non-switched Air Conditioning power. Wired alarm systems are incredibly dependable and you don't need to fret about their battery going out. However, they are fixed in location, might need professional installation, and they're not portable.</p>
