Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the issue. Although our testing should not be taken as definitive, our company believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems normally include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom. If a patient is having trouble, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is usually open or normally closed.

<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their portability, impermanence and expandability.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other components can quickly be set up at various homes later, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new parts too. Wireless security plans also enable remote control of the system and basic home automation.
