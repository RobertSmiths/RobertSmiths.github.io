<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
