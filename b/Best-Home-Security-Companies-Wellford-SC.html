<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
