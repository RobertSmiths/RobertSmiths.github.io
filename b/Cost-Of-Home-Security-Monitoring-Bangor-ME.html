<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by.
