<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it ought to be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
