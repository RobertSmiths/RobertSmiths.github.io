<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensors, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
