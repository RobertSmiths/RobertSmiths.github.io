<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends prospective culprits are less likely to commit crime if they believe they are being watched or have a greater danger of being apprehended. This is also referred to as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense prevention method, which argues that opportunities to offend can be decreased by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, reducing benefits from crime commission, and reducing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the transgressor must be aware of the added surveillance for it to attain its desired impact.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>

Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and informs, sensors, access control, and so on.
