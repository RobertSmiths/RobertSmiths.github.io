<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an infraction. When a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
