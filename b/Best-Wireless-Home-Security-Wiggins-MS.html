<p>Discover how to create, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and decrease crime. The Ring Floodlight Camera combines 2 essential devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds motion, it switches on its 2 effective LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording. The Floodlight Web cam also has a loud speaker, so you can speak to whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their responses. Outdoor cameras are among the very best methods to deter (and catch) burglars, vandals, and other scalawags.

<p>No false alarm penalties: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the cops for an incorrect alarm. Because the homeowner is in charge of the system, cops are only called if there's a genuine emergency. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will contact cops if a property owner can't verify a false alarm. If  police are contacted for an incorrect alarm, homeowners might need to pay a fine for dispatching authorities unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the potential for subsequent charges and false alarms.</p>

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.
