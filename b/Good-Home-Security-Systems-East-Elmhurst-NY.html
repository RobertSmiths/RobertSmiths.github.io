<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard wise home gadgets like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you watch out for would-be package thieves or talk with visitors who drop in.</p>

Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.

Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
