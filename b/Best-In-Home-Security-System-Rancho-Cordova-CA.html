<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a sensational value. It gets an Exceptional rating for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.

Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

The designs we've examined so far either record really short clips, leave giant spaces in between those brief clips, or require charging regularly.</p>
