<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
