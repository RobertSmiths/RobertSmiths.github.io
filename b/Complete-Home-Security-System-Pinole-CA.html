This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch.
