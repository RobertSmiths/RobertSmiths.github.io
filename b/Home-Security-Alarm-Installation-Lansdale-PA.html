<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics since this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>The length of time does it typically require to flip to your alarm monitoring service? I use VOIP today. May transfer to cellular at some time in the future but staying with dial-up for now. Naturally, you might want to think of buying a security camera or 2 to accompany your system, but going with the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 overall) is a little bit more pricey than Frontpoint's many basic package for $320 (or $255 with the 20% marketing offer), which doesn't include a camera.</p>
