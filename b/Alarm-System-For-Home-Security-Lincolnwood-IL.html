<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their portability, expandability and impermanence. Renters, unlike homeowners, typically avoid making permanent modifications to their homes.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
