<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound however subtle changes to the character of our public areas. When people are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they may be seen at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people may discover to be cautious about the books and periodicals they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers."

<p>Are you in a home with a pre-wired security system? If so, having a hardwired security system set up might be an easier and more budget-friendly choice.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
