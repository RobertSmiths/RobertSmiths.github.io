<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, need to offer a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more available for a monthly cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to effectively discover motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it might leave you with tape-recording spaces during important security events. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd advise one of our top choices, however the Arlo is fantastic for checking in on family and family pets-- or stray felines sliding around your yard.</p>

So, how do we get your alarm to communicate with the monitoring station? Much in the very same method you do - we can link via the internet or via a wireless mobile phone signal.</p>
