As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "people may learn to be mindful about the regulars and books they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers.
