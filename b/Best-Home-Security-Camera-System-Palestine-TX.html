<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
