<p>Nearly all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensor that will set off the camera to tape video when motion is detected.

For instance, if a motion detector trips in one area, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the customer. A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in an adjacent zone within a short time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch immediately. This integrates in increased protection and a stop working safe ought to a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
