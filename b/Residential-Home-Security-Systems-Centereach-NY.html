That normally indicates you can register for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination costs or other hidden charges. Aspects we thought about consisted of the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring strategy, can window sensing units and door sensing units be included, whether the system had a mobile app, can it deal with your door locks and can it be included into an existing smart home setup, including with voice commands via Amazon Alexa.</p>
