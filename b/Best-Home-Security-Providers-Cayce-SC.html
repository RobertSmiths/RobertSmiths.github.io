<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
