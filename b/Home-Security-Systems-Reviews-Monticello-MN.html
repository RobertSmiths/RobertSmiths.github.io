<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, however low signal strength and poor connection are still typical complaints.
