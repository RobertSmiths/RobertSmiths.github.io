Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you walk by.
