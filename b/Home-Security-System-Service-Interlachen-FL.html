Where other alarm companies provide a hodgepodge of third-party equipment, Vivint styles its own things. Where some alternatives, like ADT, have good equipment but so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have a few of the best features on the marketplace, consisting of video analytics and 4K image sensors (as well as more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>
<p>Ring is among the most significant names in the plugged-in home security game, and the Ring Indoor Camera is created to pair with the company's Ring - Always Home app, as well as,'s Turner points out, video doorbells. You can even pair numerous cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Bear in mind that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But considering that the majority of retail theft wouldn't journey an alarm anyhow (a worker slipping some extra cash while providing a customer modification, for instance), we believe it's more important to have high-quality images so you have the proof you require.

However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
