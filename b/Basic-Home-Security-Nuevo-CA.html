Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need.

If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage when you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>

Video files are large, which implies a great deal of space is needed. There are a handful of companies that provide complimentary video storage, however the video is sent to a cloud account and only kept for a few days. For longer access to video, expect to pay a monthly storage charge.</p>

<p>As you just found out, there are 2 broad classifications of security cameras. What you usually find at shops are consumer-grade cameras, which typically come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and cost less than a thousand dollars (US $) for the set. The second classification of camera, commercial-grade cameras, generally begins at about $400 (US) per camera-- a considerably higher cost.

<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>

Operators at the station see the signal and take proper action, such as getting in touch with property owners, notifying authorities, or dispatching private security forces. Such signals might be sent by means of dedicated alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>
