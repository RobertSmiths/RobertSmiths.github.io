<p>Wireless home security systems require batteries. For that reason, you will need to check and change the batteries regularly, which takes more money, effort, and time.

Because contract-based security systems usually do not come with in advance charges. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year contracts!
