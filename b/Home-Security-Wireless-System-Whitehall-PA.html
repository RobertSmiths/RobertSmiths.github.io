As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions.
