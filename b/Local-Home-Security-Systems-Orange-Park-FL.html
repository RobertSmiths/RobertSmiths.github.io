<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
