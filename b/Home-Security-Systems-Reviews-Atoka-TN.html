If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute substantially to authorities ability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize police action to alarmed homes) a inefficient and costly approach to theft decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
