<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When people are being seen by the authorities - or conscious they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You don't wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "people might learn to be mindful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or druggies."
