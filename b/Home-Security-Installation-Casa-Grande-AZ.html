Another location where Arlo excels is customer support. After long-term testing this camera given that we first made it a choice in 2016, we saw that our Arlo Q started forecasting a pink tint, which appears to be an ongoing problem for some owners. We called consumer assistance, which used a complimentary replacement system-- although the guarantee had actually long considering that expired.</p>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
