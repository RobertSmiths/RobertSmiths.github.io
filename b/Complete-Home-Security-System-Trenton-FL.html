<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems intended to summon cops department personnel, needs registration, assessment of fees for extreme false burglar alarms, supplies treatments for repeat transgressors, and supplies an effective date. While some vestiges of the old industry remain, today's property owners exist with a lot more alternatives.

Many new security companies are developed for Do It Yourself installation just. ADT stays old-fashioned by establishing each security system themselves.
