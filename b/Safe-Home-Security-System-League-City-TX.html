Home automation is convenient and simple, and wireless systems help you automate your home that a lot easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home devices are by their very nature wireless, and a lot of home security companies provide a home automation package with an app to from another location control everything on the system.

It isn't extremely smart. Wireless gadgets interact more firmly and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you select monitoring).</p>
<p>There's no dedicated center included here - each camera connects directly to your router via Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.
