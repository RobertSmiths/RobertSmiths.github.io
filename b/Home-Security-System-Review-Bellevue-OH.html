<p>Another essential subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much suffices.

The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
