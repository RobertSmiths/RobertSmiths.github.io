<p>TP-Link's Kasa Web cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that could match a few of our top picks. It likewise features 2 days of free cloud storage (with a choice for more ), which can pack in clips of as much as 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

Many companies offer property owners the capability to include extra parts like another camera, contact sensors, a panic button, keypad, smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, or an essential fob.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic.
