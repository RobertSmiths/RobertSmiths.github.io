Wi-Fi protection likewise affects where you place a camera: If you want to put a camera in a spot that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider upgrading your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good rule of thumb that if your smart device or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to install the camera, you likely won't have an issue.</p>
<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to buying.</p>

Most wireless systems also work with your mobile phone, providing you the capability to monitor the system when you're not in the house, as well as do things like change the thermostat or close the garage door from afar. And while professional installation is not required, there are companies that use wireless security with full installation if it's not something you want to handle yourself.</p>

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional circuitry.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level.
