<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Great clarity. I wanted to establish viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter informs, for example. However, those features come at a comparatively high rate: $5 monthly ($50 each year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 annually) for 1 month of video history.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
