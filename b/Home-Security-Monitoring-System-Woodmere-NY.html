<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>There are two outdoor security camera styles - dome or bullet-shaped. Because they provide a 360 swivel that makes it hard to identify their direction, the dome-shaped outdoor security camera is understood to be less apparent to unwelcome visitors.
