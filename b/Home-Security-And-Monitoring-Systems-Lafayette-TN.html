<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function.

In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
