<p>Home security need to never be limited by where you can position or power your cameras, indoors or outdoors. From what we've seen, Deep Sentinel is a clear winner when it comes to proactive home security and stopping criminal activity prior to it happens. They secured our home by utilizing a modern combination of live surveillance and AI technology.
