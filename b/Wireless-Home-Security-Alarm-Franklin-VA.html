Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
