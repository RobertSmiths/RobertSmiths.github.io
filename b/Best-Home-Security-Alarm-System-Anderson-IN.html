<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious attacker, given that the disruption of the network prevents the circulation of data and actually indirectly secures data by preventing it from being transferred. The typical reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing a chance for the destructive attacker to tape these codes and use numerous splitting tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security essential captured during the network healing.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it spots an intruder; an useful intercom function that enables the device to serve as a wise doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant. Security integrated with clever home automation creates the most reliable, advanced home security possible. It's why we develop wise home tech products and integrate with clever products from companies like Google and Amazon. A clever home is a secure home.</p>
