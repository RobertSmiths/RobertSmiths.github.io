Wyze's recently introduced Complete Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 per month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any spaces in between.
