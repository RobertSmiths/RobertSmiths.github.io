<p>Nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. Audio and video verification methods utilize microphones and cameras to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image snapshots. The source audio and video streams are sent over an interaction link, generally a Web protocol (IP) network, to the main station where displays obtain the images through exclusive software.

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested.

Allied Home Security can install a new system or activate an existing system in your home.
