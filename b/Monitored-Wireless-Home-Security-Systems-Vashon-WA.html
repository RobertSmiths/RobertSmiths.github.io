After researching 4 different security systems, we decided on SSA. They offered us the very best description of their services and provided us more for the cash. After having a disappointment with the local installer for ADT and canceling them, we experienced what a genuinely professional installation ought to be. We feel very safe understanding our home is protected by SSA. The New Providence Police Department is dedicated to using every resource to prevent and resolve criminal offenses and to protect citizens and their home.

Well, it's a prepackaged security kit that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring fees.
