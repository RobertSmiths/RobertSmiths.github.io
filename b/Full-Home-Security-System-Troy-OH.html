For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make customers stick with them longer, since changing monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
