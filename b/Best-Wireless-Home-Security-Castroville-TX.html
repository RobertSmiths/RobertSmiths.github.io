<p>We also love that Ring still has good clever home assistance. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with wise home devices like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your clever outlets with your general security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is relatively simple. Considering that the security systems alert property owners to suspicious activity through a mobile phone, monitoring a home is as simple as inspecting a text message.
