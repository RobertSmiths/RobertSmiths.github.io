<p>The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its third version, with a simpler and more stylish design for both app and gadgets. The base station is curvier and the sensors are smaller, but the range is better, promising connections to wireless sensing units as much as 800 feet away. We didn't go that far, but we were able to set about 40 feet in various directions, through walls to areas in the kitchen area and dining-room.
