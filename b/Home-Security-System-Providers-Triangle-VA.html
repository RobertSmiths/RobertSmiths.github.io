<p>This nifty smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During testing, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly triggering when motion was detected. We love that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
