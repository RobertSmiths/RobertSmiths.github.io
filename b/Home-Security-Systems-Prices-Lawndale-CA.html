<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
