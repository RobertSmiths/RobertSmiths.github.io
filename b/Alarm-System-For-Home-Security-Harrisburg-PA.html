<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective transgressors are less likely to devote crime if they think they are being viewed or have a greater risk of being captured. This is also referred to as the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that opportunities to upset can be decreased by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a transgressor being captured, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, reducing rewards from crime commission, and decreasing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
