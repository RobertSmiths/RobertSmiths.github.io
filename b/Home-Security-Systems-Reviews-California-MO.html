<p>This awesome smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we found it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when motion was detected. We like that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's also worth noting that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we tested and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>
