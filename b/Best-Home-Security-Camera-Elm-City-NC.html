This is likewise referred to as the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to anger can be decreased by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of an offender being captured, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing benefits from crime commission, and decreasing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
