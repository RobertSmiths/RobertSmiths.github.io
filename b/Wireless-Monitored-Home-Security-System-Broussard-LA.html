<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were typically missing, despite showing up in the app's activity timeline.
