As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
