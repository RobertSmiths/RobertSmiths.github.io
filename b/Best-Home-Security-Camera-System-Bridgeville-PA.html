<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
