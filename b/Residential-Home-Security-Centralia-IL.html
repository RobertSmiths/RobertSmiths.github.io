<p>We like that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision alternative, however the black and white version can in fact be clearer and offer you higher-quality footage. This isn't actually a huge offer thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick with white and black.

<p>Professional installation was virtually the only method to put in a home security system 15 years back. Innovation has come such a long way that Do It Yourself systems can offer the exact same level of security (and typically more) with a self set up system. Even more, there can be fringe benefits to a DIY system because they're usually much easier to transfer to another home if you move. For someone looking for a more complex setup like home automation, or someone that wants a trained expert to make the suggestion for the setup, specialist installation is a great option. We have actually found that most people that were uncertain about self setting up a home security system in fact wound up finding the process very easy. There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be especially valuable in this stage.</p>
