<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
