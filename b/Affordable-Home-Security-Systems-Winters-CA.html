<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder before purchasing.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
