<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute substantially to authorities ability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund authorities action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to burglary decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
