<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
