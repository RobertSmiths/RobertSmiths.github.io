<p>One category where SimpliSafe has gotten somewhat dissatisfying reviews is customer service. Since they can often result in additional charges, many users are not very pleased with the way dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for false alarms. Furthermore, the overall viewpoint is that the company's client service is not very practical when it pertains to fixing issues and repeating use problems.

Then you go into the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi information. (You must play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines howl, felines squeal, children cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
