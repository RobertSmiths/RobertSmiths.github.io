<p>No false alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the cops for a false alarm. Considering that the homeowner is in charge of the system, cops are just contacted if there's a genuine emergency situation. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will get in touch with police if a property owner can't validate a false alarm. If  cops are called for an incorrect alarm, property owners may have to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly. A self-monitored home limits the potential for subsequent charges and false alarms.</p>
