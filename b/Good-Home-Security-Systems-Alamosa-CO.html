<p>Many security cameras can be used both inside your home and outdoors. They generally have the exact same features like night vision or remote viewing, however they differ in resilience. Outdoor cameras ought to be weather condition resistant and in some cases, completely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance rating are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices since their style enables minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will provide more accurate and less regular notifies.</p>
<p>This system utilizes an electro-magnetic field disturbance concept based upon 2 unshielded (or 'leaky') coax cables buried around 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter discharges continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is received by the other cable.
