Consider that some companies lock you into their service for a year or more. Breaking the contract could cost you hundreds of dollars. The Arlo Pro is the company's very first wireless home security camera, and though it's been eclipsed in functions and resolutions by more recent designs, the original still holds up well.

<p>Analog cameras are the pioneers of the surveillance market and are an affordable, low-resolution security service. While easy and incredibly affordable to establish, analog cameras will likely be phased out as newer, better technology is established.

<p>However, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. Still quite pricey, however they can catch video images at resolutions of 1, 2, 3, 5 and even up to 11 Mpix. Unlike with analogue cameras, information such as number plates are easily readable. At 11 Mpix, forensic quality images are made where each hand on a person can be distinguished. Since of the much higher resolutions readily available with these kinds of cameras, they can be set up to cover a broad area where generally several analogue cameras would have been required.</p>
<p>With an analog system, coax cable is needed for sending video footage from the CCTV security cameras.

Bottom Line: ADT is a highly-customizable system that uses wireless and hardwired systems. We consider them the pioneers of home security and the most popular provider among property owners.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over long distances.

In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally through 110VAC power.</p>
