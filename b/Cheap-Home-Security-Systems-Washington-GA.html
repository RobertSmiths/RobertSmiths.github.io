<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Call for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost. Because it comes with several door and window sensors for full coverage, we recommend the eight-piece kit. We also suggest including a doorbell camera at some time. The in advance cost of wireless security systems can be costly. Factor in the upfront cost of the control panel, activation costs, monitoring costs and all equipment. If the wireless security system is not on a contract basis, all of these costs will be paid in advance.
