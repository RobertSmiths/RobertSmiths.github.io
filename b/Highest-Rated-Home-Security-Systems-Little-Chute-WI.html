<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
