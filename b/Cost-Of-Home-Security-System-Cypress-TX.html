Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you intend to store and for how long you prepare to keep recorded video footage. The footage is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution.
